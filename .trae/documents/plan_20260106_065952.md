## Fix Welcome Interface and Build Output Issues

### Issues Identified
1. **Browse button text is still in Chinese** - Hardcoded "浏览..." needs to be changed to user's selected language (default English)
2. **Language selection elements overlapping** - Layout issue in the language selection grid
3. **Language change doesn't update UI immediately** - Need to add dynamic language switching
4. **Compiled files are messy** - Need to organize build output

### Fix Steps
1. **Fix Browse Button Text**
   - Update WelcomeWindow.xaml line 56: Change hardcoded "浏览..." to English "Browse..."
   - Or add localization key for the browse button

2. **Fix Language Selection Layout Overlap**
   - Update WelcomeWindow.xaml line 62: Adjust column width for language label
   - Ensure proper margin/padding between elements
   - Test layout with different language selections

3. **Implement Dynamic Language Switching**
   - Add SelectionChanged event handler to language ComboBox in WelcomeWindow.xaml
   - In the handler, update LocalizeDictionary.Instance.Culture immediately
   - Ensure UI updates reflect the new language selection

4. **Organize Compiled Files**
   - Update Diffusion.Toolkit.csproj to configure output directory structure
   - Ensure only necessary files are in the root output directory
   - Move supporting files to appropriate subdirectories

### Expected Results
- Browse button displays in English by default, or user's selected language
- No overlapping elements in language selection
- UI language updates immediately when user selects a different language
- Clean build output with organized files

### Files to Modify
- Diffusion.Toolkit/WelcomeWindow.xaml - Fix button text and layout
- Diffusion.Toolkit/WelcomeWindow.xaml.cs - Add dynamic language switching
- Diffusion.Toolkit/Diffusion.Toolkit.csproj - Configure build output structure
